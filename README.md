Happy Coding!

I am happy with this project though I know there is more I could have done. I ran out of time to keep working on the like buttons and never even atempted to get the comments or dm
buttons to work as that is pretty beyond my current ability. I did get some functionality with the like buttons but I wasn't please with the way they worked so I commented them out. I did decide to add a view feed button on first load which then works to bring up all three of the posts. I did some other bits to help the appearance in my opinion and ignored some other things for sake of time. All in all I'm happy with it for now but this project felt more real than many of the other projects I've done and I liked it.
